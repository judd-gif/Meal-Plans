1 = NAME
    ex = Home Chef
    
    DESCRIPTION=  Like its name suggests, Home Chef provides customers with the tools necessary to become true masters of the kitchen. From Home Chefâ€™s fresh, high-quality ingredients to well-written recipes that break down intimidating cooking methods into digestible steps, everything about this service made me feel like I was preparing restaurant-worthy (or at least guest-worthy) meals without running around like a maniac. Home Chef now offers oven-ready meals (which come with their own cooking trays) and the option to swap out proteins, making it appealing to an even wider swath of busy cooks.

    PRICE =   Visit Home Chef for updated pricing. When tested, meals were $9.95 per serving, regardless of frequency or quantity. Meals can serve 2, 4, or 6 people. We liked this service so much, we've partnered with Home Chef to offer Reviewed readers $15 off their first 4 orders.
